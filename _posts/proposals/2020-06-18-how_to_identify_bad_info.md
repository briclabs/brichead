1. (-3 pts: no) Is the source of this information a known propagandist?
2. (-3 pts: no) Does the source of this information have a history of promoting misinformation or misleading information?
3. (-2 pts: no) Is this information corroborated by unrelated information sources?
4. (-1 pts: no) Does this information use emotionally charged language, punctuation, or typesetting?
5. (-1 pts: no) Does this information make claims without citing any references?
6. (-1 pts: no) Does this information offer non-primary references to support their claims?
7. (-1 pts: no) Does this information primarily convey an opinion instead of facts?
8. (-2 pts: no) Was the information reviewed by anyone before it was publicized?

Note that this rating system can never produce a value greater than zero.
Therefore, even if all the answers to the above questions are 'no', the information must still prove its worth and accuracy.
However, the lower its score, the more likely the information should be discarded as unvaluable or inaccurate.
