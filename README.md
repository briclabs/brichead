## BricHead

This site is part blog, part database, part social media, and part codebase. It is meant to allow collaboratively improving a "post" (a logical argument, proverb, or similar) so that it can become more perfect in it expression of its intended meaning, within the context of its intended purpose.

## Contributions

As this site is hosted via GitHub Pages, contributions can be made through pull requests, as if the written human words here were code. This allows comparison, discussion, and so forth to be organized and archived within the database that is this site's repository.

## Disclaimer

This site contains collaborative content, and, content that is not expected to be perfect or accurate versus the intent of any of its authors (original or subsequent). Therefore any views, ideas, and so forth that are presented here should always be considered an unfinished product, and therefore flawed.

## Motivation

Bric has spent a lot of time discussing controversial topics with others. Bric's motivation is to better understand others, and to perfect themselves as a person, to the benefit of all other persons, to the best of Bric's abilities. Bric wants to be happy. Bric wants you to be happy. Bric wants everyone to be happy. Understanding others is very difficult sometimes. This methodology is being explored as a potential way to collaboratively perfect expressions in a consensus-driven, organized, efficient, and attributable approach. To that extent, this pursuit, and the fruit it bears, should also always be considered an unfinished product, and therefore flawed.
